            <p>Our project focuses on designing and developing a software solution to support precision farming practices. The software enables farmers to visualize the layout of their precision farms, accurately calculate field areas, and selectively remove subdivisions for optimized land management. Through an intuitive interface and efficient tools, farmers can easily manage their agricultural plots. By accepting precision farm layout information in common GIS file formats, the software generates graphical representations that highlight field boundaries and subdivisions, providing a clear spatial distribution. The total area calculation feature aids farmers in resource allocation and planning. Additionally, the software allows interactive subdivision removal, updating the visualization and recalculating the total area accordingly. Developed using appropriate geospatial libraries like Shapely and GeoPandas in Python, the solution ensures efficiency, even for large and complex layouts. The project includes comprehensive documentation, validation tests, and visual representations to assist farmers in utilizing the software effectively.</p>
